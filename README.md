## Description

This website serves as a personal portfolio for myself. It was built using Bootstrap and designed to be responsive. The most difficult part of this project for me was getting the collapsible navbar to work properly. The navbar collapses at <768px viewport and turns into a hamburger button with dropdown menu.
